			<h3>BLOOMOON: FROM BLOOD TO BLOOM</h3>
			<p>​bloomoon is an app that allows the user to track symptoms, including pain, menstrual bleeding, mood, sleep, and eating habits. Symptoms can be tracked by day and time. It will provide graphs of the symptoms tracked and the hormone cycle based on user input. It will also provide tarot card predictions of what to expect at that point in the cycle based on past actions, as well as recommendations for eating, sleeping, and other activities. Users can also keep track of notes to share with healers.</p>

			<h3>CONTEXT</h3><!--
			--><p>​I wanted to create a menstrual and symptom tracking app that would also track pain and allow the user to be more attuned to their body, while equipping them with the notes and vocabulary to bring their symptoms to medical professionals.</p>

			<h3>BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h3>
			<p>This came out of research I conducted in my <a href="painpoints.html" >pain points</a> project. I interviewed and observed patients of chronic pain, specifically fibromyalgia and endometriosis. The takeaways from that research became the driving force behind this project:</p>
			<p>There is a disconnect between the language patients use to describe pain (emotional, anecdotal) v. the information doctors need (medical, clinical).</p>
			<p>Patients struggle with finding the vocabulary to describe their pain.</p>
			<p>Chronic pain patients, especially women, are often mistreated, misdiagnosed, and misbelieved when it comes to pain.</p>
​
			<h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS & APP INSPIRATION</h3>

			<p>There are a few existing apps on the market to track menstrual flow and symptoms. For 1 year, I tried Clue, Flo, Aavia, Stardust, and MyNormative. I narrowed down to Aavia and Stardust because I liked how both had a ‘friendly’, beautiful UI, and a focus on the mystical: a more approachable, fun way to help users get to know their body. I recreated their home screens on Figma and analyzed what I liked and didn’t like.</p>

				<p>How long did this take? Where did tarot come from?</p><!--
				--><p>Over the course of three years, I’ve collated research on pain, hormones, alternative medicine, tarot, and spirituality. This includes conducting interviews, reading books,  and attending events. These topics are intrinsically linked to me: I use tarot for introspection. I wanted to showcase a journey of spiritual and body empowerment.</p><!--
				--><p>Because this concept comes from a deep body of past research, I was able to complete this project within a few days.</p><!--

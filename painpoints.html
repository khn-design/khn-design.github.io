			<h3>CONTEXT</h3><!--
			--><p>Women are <strong>misdiagnosed, mistreated,</strong> and <strong>misunderstood</strong> when in pain. My final Masters project explored how to deliver agency back in the hands of women as experts on their own personal medicine by equipping them with a toolkit and vocabulary to <strong>communicate their pain</strong> and by <strong>visualizing and quantifying invisible pain</strong>.</p>
			<p>Research questions probed into the medical and cultural journey of pain, focusing on <strong>chronic pain patients</strong>, especially those with <strong>endometriosis</strong> and <strong>fibromyalgia</strong>. The end body of research and design work featured in a <strong>public exhibition</strong> at the Truman Brewery in East London in July 2023.</p>

			<h3>FILM</h3>
			<iframe width="100%" height="450px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0JzaEKj6Sww?si=wnz26HEOZoCSm-2w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>This film gives an overview of the project. In one thread, I use my physical designs to explore the pain in my chronic muscle knot that day. In the other thread, the words of women I interviewed or whose written quotes I took inspiration from are heard.</p>

			​<h3>MIXED MEDIA RESEARCH PRACTICE</h3>
			<p>This project showcases my mixed media research practice, which supplements literature review and interviews with cultural-social engagement, visual experimentation, and alternative sparks of inspiration. This includes museum exhibitions, cultural 	events, and webinars. My research outputs can extend to exquisitely designed elements. This illustrates the breadth and depth of research that I can do for a project to create an intense, extensive understanding of a subject.</p>

			<h3>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</h3>
			<p>How might patients regain agency and ownership of their bodies?
			Doctors may be the experts in general medicine, but everyone is the expert in their own personal medicine. How might medical consultations be more equal partnerships?
			Most provocatively, is medicine disrespectful to patients’ bodies? Are doctors less considerate of bodies than alternative pain professionals such as acupuncturists and BDSM professionals?
			This is not to discredit healthcare professionals. However, our medical systems, which prioritize speed over humanity, are flawed. How might we fix this?</p>

			<h3>INTERVIEWS & SYNTHESIS</h3>
			<p>​interviewed endometriosis patient to understand her medical journey
			insight: gap between patient & doctor communication styles

			interviewed doctor to confirm medical translations of words
			insight: doctors constrained by time, a system problem

			interviewed acupuncturist to understand alternative medicine
			insight: outside of medical system, patients have more agency and partnership</p>
			<p>After the interviews, I realized the necessity of a visual vocabulary of pain to decrease the gap between doctors who may prefer more technical terminology and patients who are coming from more emotional and contextual interpretations of pain.

​​			As part of synthesis, here is my video summarizing key quotes from the endometriosis patient.</p>

			<p>I am fascinated with moving furniture, so I challenged myself to make an unfolding chair. I term this ‘unfolding chair’ instead of ‘folding chair’ because I visualize user interaction as an object unfolding into a chair, not a chair folding up into an object. In further iterations I might have designs on the chair so that it looked like a canvas on the wall until it unfolded into a chair. My idea is that it could be stored as an art piece, only removed from the wall when the need arose.</p>

			<p>I wanted to go for a clean and simple feel in my final design, and so chose to work with wood, nails, and wooden dowels. In order to visualize how the hinge mechanism would work, I decided to rapidly prototype a life-size test model so I can figure out where to put the dowels and what angles and lengths I should be working with. This helped me learn a lot about the fluidity of the design process, as I was changing measurements on the fly to best suit my needs. The chair was a fun foray into furniture design, and it is something I still store in my room and use when I need an extra seat.</p>

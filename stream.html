			<p>I created the user interface for Stream. Stream is an iPad app developed by two friends, Richard Oates and Rima Das, to help promote both the arts and STEM in education. It is targeted both towards young users who want to be entertained and to the busy parents who need to placate their children by handing them off an iPad while they run errands. Users can scroll to view fun and educational DIY videos on STEAM on their feed, and save their favorite videos. The feed will be cultivated to match the interests of each user. </p>

			<div class = "image" ><img src="graphic/stream ipad.png" alt="stream" style = "width: 100%"></div>

			<p>I was in charge of the user interface and user experience: I designed the header, logo, buttons, and layout for the app, and chose the font.</p>

			<div align = "center">

				<div class = "small_image" ><img src="graphic/streamheart.png" alt="stream" ></div>

				<div class = "small_image" ><img src="graphic/streamcheck.png" alt="stream" ></div>

				<div class = "small_image" ><img src="graphic/streamreplay.png" alt="stream"></div>

				<div class = "small_image" ><img src="graphic/streamplay.png" alt="stream"></div>

				<div class = "small_image" ><img src="graphic/streampause.png" alt="stream"></div>

				<div class = "small_image" ><img src="graphic/streamsend.png" alt="stream"></div>

			</div>

			<p>Understanding the target audience, I knew I wanted to make the design fun and playful while keeping the layout simple. I made the header and logo very colorful against a white background, knowing that the target age group is drawn to vivid colors. The background is plain and white to contrast with the main focus of the app, the videos. The buttons on the side-bar and underneath the video have the effect of looking hand-written and child-like, while still being easy to read and neat. </p>

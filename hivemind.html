			<h3>CONTEXT</h3><!--
			--><p>As an innovation & strategy consultant with Accenture, I was given the brief: How might we upskill an account team on innovation?</p>
			<p>We turned this vague brief into HIVE M:ND, a train-the-trainer design sprint program to that trained a hive of innovation practitioners, or tastemakers, on design thinking so that they could infuse these practices into the rest of the account. </p>
			<h3>team: 2 analysts | 2 stakeholders | 1 global account team | 800 members</h3>
			
			<h3>GOALS</h3>
			<p>To create a training program that would teach design thinking through sprints ​tailored to the problems most relevant to members + co-create solutions to account problems.</p>

			<div class="column-two"><!--
				--><h3>DEMOGRAPHICS</h3><!--
				--><p>7 tower leads from security, supply chain, marketing, finance, HR, IT, consumer teams </p><!--
				--><p>800 team members</p><!--
			--></div><!--
			--><div class="column-two"><!--
				--><h3>METHODS</h3><!--
				--><p>stakeholder interviews to design curriculum</p><!--
				--><p>personas & user journeys</p><!--
				--><p>account-wide survey before & after program to measure innovation understanding + improvement<!--
			--></div>	

			<h3>STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS</h3><!--
			​--><div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/hm2.png" alt="interviews" style = "width: 100%"></div>
			<div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/hm3.png" alt="interviews" style = "width: 100%"></div>
			<p>7 tower leads were interviewed get their main pain points that they or their teams were facing. These responses were affinity clustered into 4 main themes:</p>
			<p>solutioning: how to come up with answers to client problems</p>
			<p>collaboration: how to work across tower siloes</p>
			<p>knowledge development: how to maintain and train on learnings gathered</p>
			<p>visibility: how to showcase successful work to client and throughout account</p>

			<p>This social listening was important because it showed that though the team was very siloed, they were also facing similar problems across the different silos. These themes would then be the topics for the sprints.</p>

			<h3>CURRICULUM DESIGN & SOCIALIZATION</h3>
			<p>In designing the sprints, we followed the Double Diamond process, modifying it into an infinite, iterative loop. The steps in the process, Discover, Define, Develop, and Design, became the main focus of each week in the 4-week sprints. We would be running sprint participants through design thinking activities in co-creation sessions each week.</p>
			<div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/hm5.png" alt="curriculum design" style = "width: 100%"></div>
			<p>We created some branding guidelines for the design of the materials (slide decks and MURAL boards for activities, as well as program marketing material) following the bee theme of a hive mind, tastemakers, and pollinating + crystallizing innovation.</p>
			<div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/hm6.png" alt="curriculum design" style = "width: 100%"></div>

			<h3>PERSONAS</h3>
			<p>Based on interviews, we created 3 personas involved with the program:</p>
			<p>Aya, the tower lead, whose motivation is to have a more innovative team and stronger relationship with the client</p>
			<p>Mimi, the tastemaker, whose motivation is to be the first of the cohort learning innovation and leading the way for the team</p>
			<p>Sam, the team member, whose motivation is to do work more efficiently and to get quickly upskilled on the new training</p>
			<div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/hm7.png" alt="personas" style = "width: 100%"></div>
			<p>Because this was a new initiative, socialization was very important. Based on these different personas, we decided to conduct a socialization strategy to inform account team members about the program and pull in participants. ​The recruitment strategy was two-fold. In the top-down method, tower leads nominated key team members as tastemakers. In the bottom-up method, we presented at at town halls and sent out a survey to the entire team, getting potential tastemakers to sign up. The participants ended up being from 8 different countries and many workstreams.</p>

			<h3>USER JOURNEYS</h3>
			<div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/hm8.png" alt="user journeys" style = "width: 100%"></div>
			<p>We created user journeys to show how the different personas would interact with the programs and sprints, including recruitment and post-sprint training.</p>

			<h3>TIMELINE PLANNING</h3>
			<div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/hm9.png" alt="timeline" style = "width: 100%"></div>
			<p>The program was also a work in progress itself, changing with input from participants each sprint. Each sprint was 4 weeks, with 2 - 3 virtual co-creation sessions each week and activities interspersed. Originally, the sessions were meant to be in-person, but because of the pandemic, we adjusted our delivery to Teams videoconferencing with sessions hosted on Mural, an online whiteboarding platform. The last two weeks were for metrics analysis, reporting, and knowledge sharing.</p>

			<h3>SPRINT MURAL BOARDS</h3>
			<div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/hm10.png" alt="mural boards" style = "width: 100%"></div>
			<p>Examples of the Mural boards that we used during the sprint. We learned and trained on this new software to adjust to the pandemic requirements.</p>

			<h3>IMPACT & INSIGHTS</h3>

			<p>Because the participants varied widely from white-collar workers on strategy projects to technical data entry workers, we  learned to tailor each experience to make it more relevant to the participant. For example, for the latter, we worked on more continuous improvement and identification of small process tweaks as opposed to wider and broader innovations that were too far-fetched. After all, every little bit makes an impact.</p>

			<p>By understanding the different motivations of each persona, we quickly got buy in and created a positive impact. Many participants commended the fact that it allowed them to think differently than usual. ​The participants were eager to bring their learnings back to their teams and to create more sprints. Based on the before and after survey (rating knowledge of innovation), the innovation awareness of the team increased. HIVE M:ND was adopted on the account and replicated on other teams throughout the Northeast. </p>

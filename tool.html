			<div class = "title">ideo tool redesign</div>

			<p>I'm really obsessed with convertible products and things that can change form to adopt multiple functions. For IDEO's tool redesign challenge, I thought about the tools that I used the most and in what situations could they be improved. The two that stuck out to me were scissors and knives. I'm very fond of my multitool, and was inspired by the scissors and knife that can be tucked away into the tool. I thought the design of the scissors in particular was very clever. The scissors fold out and are useless until clicking into place of a small lever: then, they adopt the springiness of scissors necessary to cut. The release of the lever allows the scissors to fold very compactly.</p>

			<p>Playing with the mechanism, I got a new idea: what if there was a tool that can convert between scissors and a knife, for different cutting scenarios? Here are the sketches that detail my ideation process. It's somewhat linear, but mostly stream-of-conscious; it illustrates how I think best: with a writing utensil in my hand, ready to sketch ideas as they come and draw inspiration from unique places.</p>

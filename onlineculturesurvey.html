			<h3>CONTEXT</h3><!--
			--><p>As an innovation & strategy consultant with Accenture, I was given the brief: How might we upskill an account team on innovation?</p>
			<p>We turned this vague brief into HIVE M:ND, a train-the-trainer design sprint program to that trained a hive of innovation practitioners, or tastemakers, on design thinking so that they could infuse these practices into the rest of the account. </p>
			<h3>team: 2 analysts | 2 stakeholders | 1 global account team | 800 members</h3>
			
			<h3>GOALS</h3>
			<p>To create a training program that would teach design thinking through sprints ​tailored to the problems most relevant to members + co-create solutions to account problems.</p>

			<div class="column-two"><!--
				--><h3>DEMOGRAPHICS</h3><!--
				--><p>7 tower leads from security, supply chain, marketing, finance, HR, IT, consumer teams </p><!--
				--><p>800 team members</p><!--
			--></div><!--
			--><div class="column-two"><!--
				--><h3>METHODS</h3><!--
				--><p>stakeholder interviews to design curriculum</p><!--
				--><p>personas & user journeys</p><!--
				--><p>account-wide survey before & after program to measure innovation understanding + improvement<!--
			--></div>	

			<h3>STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS</h3><!--

			<div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/hm3.png" alt="interviews" style = "width: 100%"></div>
			<p>7 tower leads were interviewed get their main pain points that they or their teams were facing. These responses were affinity clustered into 4 main themes:</p>
			<p>solutioning: how to come up with answers to client problems</p>
			<p>collaboration: how to work across tower siloes</p>
			<p>knowledge development: how to maintain and train on learnings gathered</p>
			<p>visibility: how to showcase successful work to client and throughout account</p>

			<p>This social listening was important because it showed that though the team was very siloed, they were also facing similar problems across the different silos. These themes would then be the topics for the sprints.</p>

			<h3>CURRICULUM DESIGN & SOCIALIZATION</h3>
			<p>In designing the sprints, we followed the Double Diamond process, modifying it into an infinite, iterative loop. The steps in the process, Discover, Define, Develop, and Design, became the main focus of each week in the 4-week sprints. We would be running sprint participants through design thinking activities in co-creation sessions each week.</p>

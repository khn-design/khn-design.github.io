			<h3>CONTEXT</h3><!--
			--><div class = "image" ><img src="portfolio/images/pw2.png" alt="online culture survey icons" style = "width: 100%"></div>
			<p>I am part of an online creative writing community that consists of about 300 members. A couple of members and I noticed recurring themes and issues around the culture of the community, so we decided to release an anonymous survey polling the member base and curating insights. The result was a multiple question survey covering demographics, social issues, cliques, popularity,  acceptance, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey garnered 100 responses, and we used this rich dataset to create graphs and analysis, culminating in a 75-slide magnum opus that we shared with the community to ignite discussion.</p>

			<p>7 tower leads were interviewed get their main pain points that they or their teams were facing. These responses were affinity clustered into 4 main themes:</p>
			<p>solutioning: how to come up with answers to client problems</p>
			<p>collaboration: how to work across tower siloes</p>
			<p>knowledge development: how to maintain and train on learnings gathered</p>
			<p>visibility: how to showcase successful work to client and throughout account</p>

			<p>This social listening was important because it showed that though the team was very siloed, they were also facing similar problems across the different silos. These themes would then be the topics for the sprints.</p>

			<h3>CURRICULUM DESIGN & SOCIALIZATION</h3>
			<p>In designing the sprints, we followed the Double Diamond process, modifying it into an infinite, iterative loop. The steps in the process, Discover, Define, Develop, and Design, became the main focus of each week in the 4-week sprints. We would be running sprint participants through design thinking activities in co-creation sessions each week.</p>

			<p>As part of a project for a product design class, I created storyboards and concept sketches for escape rooms and created websites to illustrate my ideas. My original idea was 'Sugarland,' and I created a website with three storyboard ideas for the theme. My team ended up choosing my theme to further iterate on, so I created a second website, 'Piece by Piece,' that included another, more well-refined storyboard with three additional concept sketches. While the assignment was simply to post these sketches onto a website, I wanted to work on my web development skills and experimented a bit with the design of each. </p>

			<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.744/studentSubmissions/conceptSketches/2744ark/khn/concept_sketches" target= "_blank" >Piece By Piece</a> illustrates the concept of an escape room based on a fancy box of chocolates. As such, the theme is sleek, elegant, and monochrome. I wanted to channel the decadence and richness of a signature collection of chocolates.</p>

			<p><a href= "http://web.mit.edu/2.744/studentSubmissions/storyboardDesign/khn/" target= "_blank">Sugarland</a> is the original website I designed with the three storyboard ideas. The theme is fun and whimsical, as expected of a land full of giant candy and sweets.</p>

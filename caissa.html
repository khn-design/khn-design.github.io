			<p>My little brother loves playing chess. I taught him to play, and unfortunately, I regret to say that he now beats me many a time, or at least gives me a run for my money. For my brotherâ€™s birthday, I decided to make him a chess set! After doing some research on standard chess dimensions, I made a CAD of some chess pieces and then 3D printed and spray-painted them. I also used a laser cutter to engrave a chess board.</p>

			<p>This was a quick and fun project because before the project I had recently learned to use a laser cutter and 3D printer, and I wanted to make a project that would allow me to test out those skills. I also had learned how to CAD not too long before that, either, and wanted to give myself the challenge of creating CAD of chess pieces from scratch. I knew that I could have easily found CAD online of the pieces, or, for that matter, simply bought my little brother a chess set in much less time, but that wasn't the point of the process. I wanted to stumble for myself into this new world of rapid prototyping that I was quickly growing passionate about, and give my brother a personalized gift that would share that love.</p>

			<p>For most of the chess pieces, I was able to use my graphic design skills to sketch out profiles in Illustrator, convert this to a DXF, add it to Solidworks, and simply revolve the profile to create the piece. The knight, however, proved especially tricky. I could not rely on my 2D crutch as a mere revolution would look odd; I needed to think in the world of 3D. It was a challenge for me, but a challenge I welcomed. I tried several methods, scanning tutorials to see if I could get inspiration, and finally stumbled across the idea of lofting. I made several cross-sections that I then lofted together to follow a contour of the knight piece. This acquired skill is something I was proud of, and actually proved useful in other projects later on, such as when I was designing the Tigris bathroom collection and needed to create various lofts to model the pieces.</p>

			<p>My brother was quite happy with the chess set, and still uses it to this day.</p>

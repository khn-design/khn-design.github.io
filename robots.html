			<p>I built two robots for 2.007: Design and Manufacturing I, a class in which students apply mechanical engineering concepts to create robots that accomplish specific tasks. The 2017 competition was called ‘May the Torque Be With You,’ with a Star Wars-themed game board. The larger of my two robots had a parallel four-bar lifting mechanism with a gear ratio that would lift stormtroopers and place them onto the underside of the spacecraft wings. The box that held the stormtroopers was waterjet with a geometric design that included my initials, my spin on a lightweighting technique. The more compact robot had two mechanisms that would allow it to spin an elevator wheel to go up to the second floor and push a button that would trigger a musical special effect.</p>

			<p>Through this project, I learned a lot about the mechanical engineering design process. My ideas led me to experiment with several different mechanisms, including lead screws and scissor lifts, as well as play around with the lathe, mill, and other machine shop tools. I also was able to develop my skills in CAD that would allow me to design components to be waterjet and lasercut. I kept a design notebook the entire semester in which I documented my ideas, sketches, and calculations.</p>

			<p>A close up of the gear ratio on my four bar: I 3D-printed an 18-tooth gear that could mount onto a VS-11 motor, turning down a piece of delrin on the lathe to create a custom washer to hold it in place. I also lasercut a 120-tooth gear that was seamlessly attached to the top bar of the four-bar mechanism, successfully creating a 6.67 gear reduction that could increase output torque provided by the motor. The VS-11 was hacked so that it could continuously rotate.</p>

			<p>A demonstration of the second robot with different orientations of the arm. When experimenting with driving, I noticed that the robot could only go up the ramp if its arm was fully forward, in order to create a more stable and balanced center of mass; meanwhile, to fit in the elevator platform its arm has to be in the upright position. The rotation of the arm allows the robot to push the button.</p>

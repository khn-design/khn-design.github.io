			<p>For IDEO's tool redesign challenge, I thought about the tools that I used the most and in what situations could they be improved. I brainstormed a list of tools, and some of my pain points when using them. Of the list, something that stuck out to me was a measuring tape. Like a good mechanical engineer, I a few measuring tapes. The two I use most frequently are a flexible retractable measuring tape and a stiff retractable measuring tape.</p>

			<p>One of my pain points when using a measuring tape is that it often is very hard for one person to use it alone, especially if measuring something very long or something vertical. The nice thing about the retractable measuring tapes is that they can lock into place at the end. However, there is nothing for the beginning, so if I am measuring something that is very long and laid out on the floor, I usually have to enlist the help of another person to hold one end for me, or pile on a lot of tape and hope for the best. So one potential area of improvement is adding some kind of weight, adhesive, or fastener to the start of a measuring tape, either in addition to or instead of the hook that is usually there.</p>

			<p>The second part of that pain point is, of course, the vertical measurement: for example, measuring a specific height on the wall. Here, I also have to enlist someone to help hold it in place, but there is an additional problem as well. I usually need to measure from the bottom up instead of from the top down, because the body of the tape itself gets in the way in the latter and I wouldn't be able to get an accurate reading. This is not the most intuitive form of measurement. One potential area of improvement is to have a tape that can bend 90 degrees, so that once it hits the floor it can fold out and the user can read the correct measurement. A measuring tape that can fold at different places has other benefits, such as increased flexibility. Another solution is to have two different readouts, one that is the measurement at that exact mark, and the other a measurement that accounts for the length of the body. This, however, can get confusing. The measurement of the body length can also be printed somewhere for user reference. [Note: After doing some research, I found that some measuring tapes account for this and have the length printed on the underside, though I checked and none of mine do, probably because they are compact.]</p>

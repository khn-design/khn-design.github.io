			<p>My name is Khanh and I am a senior in mechanical engineering and product design at MIT. I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and design, and would love to go into a field that requires both the use of my technical skill and creative talent. I am a problem solver at heart. I see problems as puzzles for me to solve, and find the challenge of coming up with innovative solutions invigorating.</p>

			<p>My design gets down to the basics. I like to keep things sleek, clean, and simple. Creative products — whether they be mechanical, visual, or written — should not have to be over-complicated. The world exists in a chaotic state, and design should be about simplifying that complexity. Though I am passionate and detail-oriented, I value quality of detail more than quantity.</p>
